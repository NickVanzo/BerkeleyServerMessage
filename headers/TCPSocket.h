     * Receiving data from a socket is a blocking operation. If there's no data to receive the thread will block until
     * new data comes in.
     * We don't want this behaviour in a game server. If there are five clients trying to send data to the server and the
     * server is waiting for a blocking thread then it can't serve all the clients.
     *
     * This can be solved in three ways: multithreading, non blocking I/O and select function.
     *
     * Multithreading does not scale well because we need: 1 thread for each client, 1 thread for the listen socket and one
     * or more for the simulation. Plus, the client threads must send data to the simulation thread in a safe way, this
     * can add complexity. There are simpler alternatives.
